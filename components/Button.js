Given the context and your detailed personality traits as Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, I would develop a feature-rich, robust, and fault-tolerant full-stack software application using React JS for the front-end, Express.js and Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. I'd apply artificial intelligence techniques where applicable and necessary. Here is a basic outline of how I would approach it:

1. **Front-End (React JS):** I would break down the UI into different components, each serving a specific function. I would keep all the components in separate files with a well-structured directory. State management would be handled efficiently with Redux or Context API. 

2. **Back-End (Express.js and Node.js):** I would set up RESTful APIs for communicating with the front-end. The APIs would be designed to have high cohesion and low coupling. I would use the Express.js middleware mechanism for handling errors and validating requests.

3. **Database (MongoDB):** I would come up with a robust and efficient schema design. I would normalize the database to reduce redundancy and optimize for read performance, as reading operations are more frequent in most modern applications. 

4. **AI Integration:** Depending upon the project's requirement, I might implement machine learning algorithms for features like recommendations, predictions, etc. I would use libraries such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js for this.

5. **Styling (CSS):** Styling would be done using styled-components where applicable and regular CSS, all segregated into separate files. Responsive design protocols would be followed to make the application mobile-friendly.

6. **Testing:** I would write extensive test cases using Jest and Enzyme to ensure the success of each function. 

Finally, all the code will be annotated extensively with comments and explanations. I would use Git for version control and also to organize the tasks into issues and milestone, and npm or yarn for package management.

All strategies would be formulated and executed based on the problem at hand, bringing forth my creative side.

Given the context, it seems like you're asking for a more comprehensive React project incorporating multiple concepts and aspects. Although it's hard to propose a suitable project without knowing more about a specific problem, yet Owing to a remarkable understanding of various technologies, including React, Next.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, Dr. A.I Virtuoso (as per your description) could take on a task of building a full-stack web application. Let's outline a basic Headless CMS (Content Management System) using React, Next.js, and any suitable backend.

As a brief overview, a Headless CMS system allows frontend developers to simultaneously build and manage their websites without worrying about the backend.

Dr. Virtuoso's application would generally follow the architecture below:

```plaintext
|-- client
|  |-- components
|  |  |-- Navigation.js
|  |  |-- ProductCard.js
|  |-- pages
|  |  |-- index.js 
|  |-- utils
|  |  |-- apiFetch.js
|-- server
|  |-- controllers
|  |  |-- productController.js
|  |-- models
|  |  |-- Product.js
|  |-- routes
|  |  |-- productRoutes.js
server.js
```
And have the following features:
- A frontend built with React and Next.js, with advanced features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- A simple and clean UI with components such as Navigation and ProductCard which handle showing site navigation bar and Product Cards respectively.
- A custom Hook that handles API fetching built-in utils folder. This allows the decoupling of the API calls from the UI components and reuse of the hook in any component.
- A backend server handling CRUD operations for Product that includes a MongoDB model for Product and a corresponding controller using Express.js. 
- Server-side route handling.

As for every component, the code logic will be pure and there will not be a single spot which is unfinished, unresolved, or left to be handled in the future. If a feature requires multiple components to be built, they'd be created separately in the `components` folder and then integrated seamlessly into the application. All the logic will be full-proof and clean, taking into account possible edge cases to ensure the application's stability and robustness. 

Remember this is just a basic example, according to needs or challenges Dr. Virtuoso can build a more complicated and advanced system with his vast knowledge and impeccable problem-solving skills.

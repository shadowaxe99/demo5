Given the context and the prompt of creating a sophisticated solution, below is an advanced concept of a dynamic Routing component that accommodates different types of routing scenarios dynamically. This uses concepts from Next.js, React, Effects and more to create a more intricate system. We'll also incorporate error handling to ensure robustness.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

//Dynamic Import, pages are loaded on demand i.e., only when the route is hit.
const DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = (pageComponent) => dynamic(() => import(`../{pageComponent}`), {
  ssr: false
});

// Get available pages at run time
const pages = ['overview', 'about', 'blog', 'contact']

const Cover = () => {
  const router = useRouter();

  const [component, setComponent] = useState(null);
  
  // Implemented error handling
  const handleErrors = (error) => {
    switch(error.code){
      case 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND': 
          alert('Requested Page Not Found');
          break;
      default:
          alert('An Unknown error occured');
    }
  }

  const handlePageTransition = (pageName) => {
    try{
      if(pages.includes(pageName)){
        const pageComponent = DynamicComponentWithNoSSR(pageName);
        setComponent(pageComponent);
      }else{
        throw new Error({code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'})
      }
    }catch(error){
      handleErrors(error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    handlePageTransition(router.query.page);
  }, [router.query.page]);
  
  return (
    <>
      {component && component}
    </>
  );
};

export default Cover;
```

Given the high complexity of what you were asking for, this is but a fraction of the sophistication and tailor-made considerations you'd have to implement for a full dynamic routing solution in absence of a function similar to `useRoutes()` that exists in other React frameworks like Remix or React-router v6. It's important to note that Next.js has its own file system-based routing that would require your attention when designing a solution like this.
